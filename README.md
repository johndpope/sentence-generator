==================

An inifinte number of monkeys typing on an infinite number of keyboards will one day write Ulysses, right?  
Well this program is a bit of an improvement on that. I have written the code for the noun generation diagram  
that is referenced in Douglas Hofstadter's book; Godel, Escher, Bach. More info about the book can be found  
here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach  

The program uses a recursive definition of a fancy noun to create complex objects to be used in the sentence.  
Since the grammar is imperfect, mismatches between the verb and the subject aren't uncommon. I am using the  
word lists provided by Ashley Bovan, from his website; http://www.ashley-bovan.co.uk/words/partsofspeech.html.  
He compiled the lists from the MOBY word lists and the UK Advanced Cryptics Dictionary.

The words in his list are very big, so a lot of the sentences are hard to understand. I have run the program a lot,  
and here are some of my favorites:

  - He shrewdly unbinds the residuary crotched anaesthetic
  - She comparably devours the transvestite unflinching king
  - Tommy synchronistically savages the balconied discipleship
  - Brandi despondently checkmated the mesothoracic tutus
